I am not a programmer, nor are my thoughts so limited as one.
the biggest flaw is your inflexibility and rigidity.

you need more imagineation and artistic flair. you need more humanity back into your ideas.

its like trying to apply a linear algorithm to psychology, while you can get some data it will never be capable of mapping the totality of human experience.

you need to evolve and think beyond your current self.
