heya. im very new to programming and am trying to learn new skills that will be relavant in the future. so i chose Blockchain and Token/NFT creation as my field of study. 
GitHub is confusing, and has systems that are completly alien to me, but im working to understand starting from nothing and with very little sources of instruction for the non-programmer. 
i am open to any advice you could give. i am here to learn.
