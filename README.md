- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VortexHowl
i am a dumbass novice who is trying to learn how to code. 
i tried making my own spl-token but ended up breaking github cause im an idiot who doesnt understand shit
i want to learn. it would nice if sommeone would actually make how to's that are built for people who DONT KNOW ANYTHING to begin with, instead of making a guide that 
expects you to know a ton about the subject already. 

sincerely, the biggest idiot on the web who wants to learn. 

no good deed goes unpunished huh? LOL
